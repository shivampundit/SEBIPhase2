## ✅ MASTER TIPS for PRECIS & READING COMPREHENSION

---

# 📝 PART 1: PRECIS WRITING (High-Scoring Strategy)

Precis = Write **exact meaning in 1/3rd words**.

No opinion. No examples. Only essence.

---

## 🔹 Step-by-Step Method (Follow Blindly)

### ✅ Step 1: Read Twice (3 Minutes)

* 1st Read → Understand theme
* 2nd Read → Mark key ideas

Underline:
✔ Main argument
✔ Causes
✔ Effects
✔ Conclusion

Ignore:
❌ Examples
❌ Data
❌ Quotes
❌ Stories

---

### ✅ Step 2: Identify Central Theme

Ask:

> “What is the author really saying?”

Write it in 1 line (mentally).

---

### ✅ Step 3: Make Rough Outline (2 Minutes)

Before writing, note:

* Point 1 → Cause
* Point 2 → Problem
* Point 3 → Impact
* Point 4 → Solution

This prevents copying.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Write in Your Own Words

Rules:
✔ Change sentence structure
✔ Use synonyms
✔ Combine sentences
❌ No copy-paste

Bad ❌: Copy line
Good ✅: Rewrite idea

---

### ✅ Step 5: Give Proper Title (Very Important)

Title = 3–5 words

Reflect theme.

Examples:

* “Challenges of Urbanization”
* “Impact of Digitalization”
* “Need for Financial Awareness”

Wrong ❌:

* “Precis”
* “Summary”

---

## 🔴 Common Precis Mistakes (Avoid = +5 Marks)

❌ Personal opinion
❌ Examples
❌ Direct quotes
❌ First person (I, We)
❌ Wrong word limit

---

## ✍️ Ideal Precis Structure

**Title**

Paragraph (Single Block)

* Theme
* Main arguments
* Conclusion

No sub-paras.

---

# 📖 PART 2: READING COMPREHENSION (RC)

RC in SEBI = **Understanding + Interpretation**

Not memory test.

---

## 🔹 Golden Rule: “Answer from Passage Only”

Even if you know outside facts → IGNORE.

Use only given text.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step RC Strategy

---

### Step 1: Read Questions First (1 Minute)

See what they ask:

* Meaning
* Inference
* Author’s view
* Tone

Now read passage with purpose.

---

### Step 2: Read Passage Smartly

Focus on:
✔ First paragraph → Theme
✔ Last paragraph → Conclusion
✔ Linking words → However, Thus, Therefore

These show direction.

---

### Step 3: Locate → Think → Answer

For each question:

1️⃣ Find related lines
2️⃣ Understand meaning
3️⃣ Paraphrase in answer

Never copy blindly.

---

### Step 4: Answer in Full Sentences

Bad ❌:

> Yes, it is useful.

Good ✅:

> It is useful because it improves efficiency and reduces operational costs.

---

## 🔹 How to Handle Common RC Questions

### ✔️ “What does the author imply?”

→ Hidden meaning (read between lines)

### ✔️ “Explain the phrase…”

→ Give simple meaning + context

### ✔️ “Do you agree?”

→ Mostly neutral answer
Based on passage

### ✔️ “Tone of passage”

Options:

* Critical
* Optimistic
* Analytical
* Neutral

Usually: Analytical / Balanced

# ⚠️ RC Mistakes = Low Score

❌ One-word answers
❌ Outside knowledge
❌ Copy full lines
❌ Vague writing

---

# 🏆 TOPPER TRICKS (Secret Weapon)

### ✅ For Precis:

After writing, check:

> “Have I removed 60–70% words?”

If not → Too long.

---

### ✅ For RC:

Start answers with:

* “The author suggests that…”
* “The passage indicates…”
* “According to the text…”

Looks professional.
